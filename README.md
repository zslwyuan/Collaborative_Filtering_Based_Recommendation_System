If you have some questions, I would like to discuss~ ^_^  (tliang at ust dot hk)

The project consists of the following tasks:
1. To implement PMF with maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation according to the estimator interface of
scikit-learn.
2. To conduct empirical study to compare the performance of PMF by varying the number of latent factors K
and the regularization hyperparameters λu and λv .
3. To conduct empirical study to compare the performance of PMF on dense and sparse data.


command examples:

python prj3.py  --docv --sparse
